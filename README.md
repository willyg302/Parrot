Parrot
======

A social media data collection framework.

Setup
-----

1. `cd` into the __setup__ directory

2. Run the following commands in your favorite shell:

   ```bash
   $ python ez_setup.py
   $ python get-pip.py
   $ pip install facebook-sdk
   $ pip install twython
   ```

   Obviously this requires Python (2.7 is used by this project). If you already have `pip` installed, you can skip the first two commands.

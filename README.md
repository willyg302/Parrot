---

A social media data collection framework.

## Setup

> **Note**: All instructions below, unless otherwise stated, assume a UNIX environment. Depending on your privileges you may need to `sudo` things or be logged in as an administrator on Windows.

1. Get [Python](http://www.python.org/) (we use 2.7)

2. Install [strap.py](https://github.com/willyg302/strap.py)

3. Grab Parrot!

   ```
   strap init gh:willyg302/Parrot -d Parrot
   ```

And that's it! ...Okay not really. The next step is to set up proper authorization for Parrot (OAuth, secret keys, cookies, and all that good stuff).

## Authorization

### Setting up tokens.py

There should be a file in the `parrot/` directory called `tokens.py`. This file should contain all the **OAuth tokens** necessary for running Parrot, as well as a random `COOKIE_SECRET` for added security.

The `COOKIE_SECRET` is autogenerated during setup, but if for whatever reason you want a new one, you can generate it very easily by using the following Python script:

```python
import base64
import uuid
base64.b64encode(uuid.uuid4().bytes + uuid.uuid4().bytes)
```

To get the remaining **OAuth tokens** for the various social media sites, you will need to set up apps and developer accounts with them. This is left as an exercise for the reader.

**Warning**: If you do not have this file, Parrot will not run. You may choose to omit certain tokens if you do not need them, but you must at least include the `COOKIE_SECRET`. Also (it should go without saying but just in case...) this file should **NEVER** be made public.

### Defining users

By default, Parrot is password-protected by a login page. This is to prevent random people from using up the data collection quotas.

Parrot defines a set of known users as a Python dictionary called `USER_DICT` in `parrot_settings.py`. The key is the username, and the value is a salted sha256 of the corresponding password. There are a few users defined already but they probably won't be of much use to you, so delete them all.

You can create a new user by simply adding them to the dictionary. To get the password, run `strap run pass_gen` and enter a password at the prompt. The program will spit out the salted pass that you can then put into `USER_DICT`.

Usage
-----

1. Start the MongoDB daemon with `mongod`
2. Execute `strap` in the project root directory to start the server
